//Chapter 8 - exercise 1 The goal of this exercise is to practice encapsulation with some of the examples in this chapter.

//Exercise 1 (part 1)- Starting with the code in Section 8.6, write a method called powArray that takes a double array, a, and returns a new array that contains the elements of a squared. Generalize it to take a second argument and raise the elements of a to the given power.


public class Array { 
public static void main (String[] args) {

for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    a[i] = Math.pow(a[i], 2.0);
}
}
}

//Exercise 1 (part 2) - Starting with the code in Section 8.10, write a method called histogram that takes an int array of scores from 0 to (but not including) 100, and returns a histogram of 100 counters. Generalize it to take the number of counters as an argument.

public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello world!");

  }
}

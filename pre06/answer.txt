Chapter 7 Loops 
/*  Write a method called squareRoot that takes a double and returns an approximation of the square root of the parameter, using this technique. You should not use Math.sqrt.

As your initial guess, you should use a/2. Your method should iterate until it gets two consecutive estimates that differ by less than 0.0001. You can use Math.abs to 
 calculate the absolute value of the difference. 
*/

Exercise 1  
Consider the following methods:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    loop(10);
}

public static void loop(int n) {
    int i = n;
    while (i > 1) {
        System.out.println(i);
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            i = i / 2;
        } else {
            i = i + 1;
        }
    }
} 

Exercise 1 - Part1 - Draw a table that shows the value of the variables i and n during the execution of loop. The table should contain one column for each variable and one line for each iteration.
Exercise 1 - Part 2 - What is the output of this program?

Exercise 1 - Part 3 - Can you prove that this loop terminates for any positive value of n?

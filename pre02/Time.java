//Exercise 3 Chap 2.12 - part 3 make program calculate and display number of seconds since midnight.

//Exercise 3 Chap 2.12. part 4 Calculate and display the number of seconds remaining in the day.


//Exercise 3 Chap 2.12. part 5 Calculate and display the percentage of the day that has passed. You might run into problems when computing percentages with integers, so consider using floating-point.



    
//Exercise 3 Chap 2.12 part 6 Change the values of hour, minute, and second to reflect the current time. Then write code to compute the elapsed time since you started working on this exercise.
